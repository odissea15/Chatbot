#### How to set up
Please go into the [```client```](client/README.md) and [```server```](server/README.md) folders and read the README in there. Both servers must be run at the same time for it to fully work.

Once you run the server on port 4000 and the client on port 3000, open up your browser and go to localhost:3000
