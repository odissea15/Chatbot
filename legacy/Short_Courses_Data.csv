According to the Bible, throughout history there had always been a contact between the Egyptians and the Israelites. Indeed, Egyptology in the 19th century was mainly concerned with discovering cultural records and thus evidence for certain biblical events.

What use was this quintessentially English, aristocratic genre to a new Republic? To answer this question, we will study works by the great painters Gilbert Stuart, John Singleton Copley, Thomas Eakins, and John Singer Sargent. We will also go beyond painting to consider the place of portraiture in printed currency, architecture, early photography, and so-called ‘folk’ art. ","0","N/A"

Students will progress their writing to a higher level by analysing a range of editing approaches in their own fiction and in the fiction of others. This will allow reflection on practical and technical methods of prose composition, and these discussions will be supported by tutor-led debates on aspects of fiction, including voice, room for the reader, omission, unreliable narration, ironic self-revelation, existentialism, perspective and underlying plot structures. The roles of critique, redrafting and editing in composition will be examined.

But what does the notion that a person has a destiny - a fixed future - tell us about how free that person's actions really are, and how morally responsible for those actions they can legitimately be held to be? This course will examine this and associated questions concerning the relationship between there being a fixed future, free will, and moral praise or blame, all against the backdrop of George Lucas' epic tale of the triumph of good over evil in a galaxy far, far away.

We will examine the geology and geomorphology of a series of areas within easy reach of Glasgow. You will be shown how to identify a range of rocks and geomorphological features within the landscape by experienced fieldworkers. There will be five full-day excursions by private car. Walking will generally be easy and no prior knowledge of geology needed. A short preliminary meeting will be held the week before to discuss field sites and travel arrangements.","0","N/A"

We will examine where these resources are found, how we find them, and how they form. The link to plate tectonics will be explored. Practical work includes mineral recognition, description of common mineral and rock assemblages of economic importance, and methods of hydrocarbon exploration including seismic sections and sequence stratigraphy. Examples from around the world, as well as from Britain, will be described.","0","N/A"

We will consider some of these problems. Coral reefs have a long geological history, and we will examine some of their precursors from the Devonian and Jurassic, as well as look at some modern examples, and study the evolution of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. The course will consist of lectures and practical work examing specimens of fossil and recent corals.","0","N/A"
